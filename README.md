## Description

This application can be used by employers a software engineering team to quickly record relevant information about their employees.

Using inquirer, the user is prompted for information about the manager and any engineers or interns that may report to them. When the user is finished adding team members to the profile, the application will quit and an index.html file that is populated with the received data will be generated.

## Installation

This application is dependent on the Inquirer npm module to run. Before use, the user should run the command [npm i]/[npm install] in their terminal to allow the program to install dependencies. This will also install the Jest npm module that can be used for testing.

## Usage

In order to use this application, after having installed the necessary dependencies, the user should start by typing the command [node index.js] in their command terminal/console. When the command is entered properly, the user will be presented with a series of questions about the members of their team. the user will be prompted for each employees' Name, ID, and Email, but they will also be required to respond to a question depending on what role the new member has.

After the prompts for the new employee have been completed, the user will be asked again if they would either like to add a new engineer or intern or if they are done with the team profile. An example of this process in use is shown below

If the user selects "done", the process will terminate and a new index.html file will be created in the "dist" folder. The index.html will feature cards for each of the employees generated by the application as shown below

![Team Profile Generator Result index.html](Assets/index-example.png)

Running the application a second time will result in the first index.html file being overwritten. In order to save the team profile, either rename the index.html file or move it out of the "dist" folder.
